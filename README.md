# Goto-Engine

Coordinate engine and tracking brain for a computerized GoTo telescope mount.
Takes a target object from a catalog, works out exactly where it is in the
sky right now from a given location, tracks it continuously as Earth
rotates, and drives a two-axis mount to follow it — with a swappable mount
backend (simulated now, real stepper motors later).

Inspired by how commercial GoTo mounts work: pick a target, the mount finds
and tracks it automatically. This is that system, built from scratch —
coordinate math, tracking loop, and eventually motor control and camera-based
self-calibration.

## Status
Phases 1–7 complete and verified — full coordinate engine, catalog, virtual
mount, tracking loop, and CLI all working end to end in simulation. No
hardware yet; everything below was validated against reference values, not
just internal tests.

**Verified:**
- Sidereal time (JD, GMST, LST) tested against frozen USNO reference values
- RA/Dec → Alt/Az transform tested against USNO-derived Alt/Az references,
  plus zenith/pole/below-horizon boundary cases
- Full Messier catalog (110 objects) loading correctly
- Virtual mount + tracking loop producing monotonic movement over
  simulated time
- CLI live-tracks a real object end to end:
  `goto-engine track M42 --lat 38.9072 --lon -77.0369 --ticks 2`

## Why
The hard problem in a GoTo mount isn't spinning motors — it's the math. A
star's position is fixed in equatorial coordinates (RA/Dec), but where it
actually appears from a given point on Earth changes continuously as the
planet rotates. Solving and testing that math first, against known
reference values, before any hardware exists, was the point of Phases 1-7.

## Roadmap
- [x] Sidereal time / UTC handling
- [x] RA/Dec → Alt/Az coordinate transform
- [x] Object catalog (full Messier catalog, 110 objects)
- [x] Virtual mount + tracking loop
- [x] CLI target selection + live tracking
- [x] Test suite validated against USNO reference values
- [ ] Stepper mount (real hardware — blocked on parts)
- [ ] Plate solving (camera-based self-calibration — blocked on hardware)
